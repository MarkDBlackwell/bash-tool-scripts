These are GNU Bash scripts, which help in developing software on Debian 
and Cygwin.

They complement nano, Debian's recommended text editor. Nano, though 
simple, works with multiple files while cutting & pasting, and searching & 
replacing. Like Emacs, it uses Bash-like keyboard shortcuts (see 
bash-cheat-sheet.txt).
