These are GNU Bash scripts, which help in developing software on Debian 
and Cygwin.

They complement nano, Debian's recommended text editor. Nano, though 
simple, works with multiple files while doing cut & paste, and search & 
replace. Like Emacs, it uses Bash-like keyboard shortcuts (see 
bash-cheat-sheet.txt).
