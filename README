These are GNU Bash scripts, which help in developing software on Debian
and Cygwin.

They complement Nano, Debian's recommended text editor. Though simple,
Nano works with multiple files while cutting & pasting, and searching &
replacing. Like Emacs, it uses Bash-like keyboard shortcuts: see the
cheat sheet,
